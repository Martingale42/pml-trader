## Introduction

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are probabilistic models for analyzing sequences of observations that depend on unobservable states. In financial time series analysis, we often work with multiple indicators (multivariate observations) to infer underlying market states.

### Model Components
Let:
- T = number of time steps
- N = number of hidden states
- D = dimension of observation vectors
- X = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₜ] where xₜ ∈ ℝᵈ (observation sequence)
- Z = [z₁, z₂, ..., zₜ] where zₜ ∈ {1,...,N} (hidden state sequence)

### Parameters (λ)
- A ∈ ℝᴺˣᴺ : State transition matrix
- μ = {μ₁, ..., μₙ} where μᵢ ∈ ℝᵈ : Mean vectors for each state
- Σ = {Σ₁, ..., Σₙ} where Σᵢ ∈ ℝᵈˣᵈ : Covariance matrices for each state
- π ∈ ℝᴺ : Initial state distribution

## Mathematical Foundations

### Multivariate Emission Probability
For state j and observation vector x:
```math
b_j(x) = \frac{1}{(2π)^{D/2}|Σ_j|^{1/2}} exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x-μ_j)^T Σ_j^{-1}(x-μ_j))
```

### Joint Probability
```math
P(X,Z|λ) = π_{z₁}b_{z₁}(x₁)∏ₜ₌₂ᵀ a_{z_{t-1},z_t}b_{z_t}(x_t)
```

## Core Algorithms

### Forward Algorithm
```pseudocode
FORWARD(X, λ):
    Input:
        X: [T×D] matrix of observations
        λ: {A[N×N], μ[N×D], Σ[N×D×D], π[N]}
    Output:
        α: [T×N] matrix of forward probabilities
        c: [T] vector of scaling factors

    Initialize:
        α[1,j] = π[j] * b_j(x₁) for j = 1,...,N
        c[1] = 1/sum(α[1,:])
        α[1,:] = c[1] * α[1,:]

    For t = 2 to T:
        For j = 1 to N:
            α[t,j] = b_j(x_t) * sum(α[t-1,i] * A[i,j] for i = 1 to N)
        c[t] = 1/sum(α[t,:])
        α[t,:] = c[t] * α[t,:]

    Return α, c
```

### Backward Algorithm
```pseudocode
BACKWARD(X, λ, c):
    Input:
        X: [T×D] matrix of observations
        λ: model parameters
        c: [T] scaling factors from forward pass
    Output:
        β: [T×N] matrix of backward probabilities

    Initialize:
        β[T,j] = c[T] for j = 1,...,N

    For t = T-1 down to 1:
        For i = 1 to N:
            β[t,i] = sum(A[i,j] * b_j(x_{t+1}) * β[t+1,j] for j = 1 to N)
            β[t,i] = c[t] * β[t,i]

    Return β
```

### Baum-Welch Algorithm
```pseudocode
BAUM_WELCH(X, λ_init):
    Input:
        X: [T×D] observation matrix
        λ_init: initial parameters
    Output:
        λ: optimized parameters

    While not converged:
        // E-Step
        α, c = FORWARD(X, λ)
        β = BACKWARD(X, λ, c)
        
        // Calculate state probabilities
        γ[t,i] = (α[t,i] * β[t,i]) / c[t]  // [T×N] matrix
        
        // Calculate transition probabilities
        ξ[t,i,j] = (α[t,i] * A[i,j] * b_j(x_{t+1}) * β[t+1,j]) // [T×N×N] tensor
        
        // M-Step
        // Update transition matrix
        A[i,j] = sum(ξ[t,i,j] for t=1 to T-1) / sum(γ[t,i] for t=1 to T-1)
        
        // Update emission parameters for each state j
        μ[j] = sum(γ[t,j] * x_t for t=1 to T) / sum(γ[t,j] for t=1 to T)
        
        Σ[j] = sum(γ[t,j] * (x_t - μ[j])(x_t - μ[j])ᵀ for t=1 to T) / 
               sum(γ[t,j] for t=1 to T)
               
        // Update initial distribution
        π = γ[1,:]

    Return λ
```

    Input:
        X: [T×D] observation matrix
        λ: model parameters
    Output:
        z*: [T] optimal state sequence
        
    Initialize:
        δ[1,j] = log(π[j]) + log(b_j(x₁))  // [T×N] matrix
        ψ[1,j] = 0                          // [T×N] matrix for backtracking
        
    For t = 2 to T:
        For j = 1 to N:
            δ[t,j] = max(δ[t-1,i] + log(A[i,j]) for i = 1 to N) + log(b_j(x_t))
            ψ[t,j] = argmax(δ[t-1,i] + log(A[i,j]) for i = 1 to N)
            
    // Backtrack
    z*[T] = argmax(δ[T,:])
    For t = T-1 down to 1:
        z*[t] = ψ[t+1,z*[t+1]]
        
    Return z*
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. Numerical Stability
- Use log-domain computations for multiplication chains
- Apply scaling to forward-backward computations
- Regularize covariance matrices (add small diagonal term)

2. Initialization Strategies
- Use k-means clustering for initial state parameters
- Initialize A with higher values on diagonal
- Ensure Σ matrices are positive definite

## FAQ

A2: 
- Use Cholesky decomposition for covariance matrices
- Implement log-sum-exp trick for probability computations
- Regular covariance matrix updates with shrinkage

Q3: What's the computational complexity?
A3: For T time steps, N states, D dimensions:
- Forward/Backward: O(TN²)
- Emission probability: O(TND²)
- Parameter updates: O(TND²)
